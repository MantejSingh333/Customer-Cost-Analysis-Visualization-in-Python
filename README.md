# Customer-Cost-Analysis-Visualization-in-Python
Python-based data analysis and visualization project using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to analyze cost, revenue, and labor trends for a customer product over time.

roject Overview

This project analyzes customer product data to visualize financial and operational trends over time. Using Python in Google Colab, I cleaned and filtered raw CSV data for a specific product and created multiple time-series visualizations to support customer insights and decision-making.

The analysis focuses on understanding how costs, invoiced values, and labor metrics evolve year over year.

Objectives

Filter customer data for a specific product

Clean and prepare date and text fields for analysis

Visualize financial and labor trends over time

Present insights in a clear, customer-friendly format

Visualizations Created

The project includes five time-series visualizations:

Total Cost Over Time

Invoiced Value Over Time

Materials Cost Over Time

Labor Cost Over Time

Labor Hours Over Time

All charts are plotted with yearly time intervals to clearly show long-term trends.
